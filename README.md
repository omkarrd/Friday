## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Interactive Main Dashboard**: A central hub featuring a stunning, voice-reactive particle-wave sphere. The sphere and a circular vocal meter animate in real-time based on microphone input.
* **Multi-Page Navigation**: A seamless single-page application (SPA) experience that allows navigation between four distinct modules:
    * **Dashboard**: The main view with the voice-interactive sphere and system readouts.
    * **AI Terminal**: A mock command-line interface.
    * **System Manager**: Displays four real-time, animated graphs simulating CPU, RAM, Network, and Disk usage, similar to a task manager.
    * **Daily Data**: A simple file explorer interface with functionality to add and delete files.
* **Voice Control**: The UI is ready for voice commands, with a microphone toggle that activates the Web Speech API and provides visual feedback through multiple animations.
* **Hardware Simulation**: The System Manager graphs and dashboard readouts are populated with dynamically generated data to simulate a live connection to system hardware.
* **Modern & Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS, the interface features a sleek, "glassmorphism" aesthetic that is designed to be flexible for different screen sizes.
